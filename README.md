Quantitative bias analysis code for "Probabilistic Quantitative Bias Analysis for Misclassification and Uncontrolled Confounding: A Methodological Tutorial Using Real-World Data" by Nicholas Grubic, Amy Johnston, and Sonia M. Grandi

To reproduce the quantitative bias analysis results using the _episensr_ package, you can run the following programs:
- _QBA_Main_Analysis.R_ to compute the conventional and bias-adjusted estimates for the main analysis (triangular distribution)
- _QBA_Sensitivity_Analysis.R_ to compute the conventional and bias-adjusted estimates for the sensitivity analysis (normal distribution)
